This repository contains three projects: facial keypoints detection, image captioning and robot landmark detection and tracking, 
each project provides an introduction to the techniques in the specific topic. Computer vision topic is an active research field, some of these techniques decribed here are intended as an introduction.

Projects
--------
Facial Keypoint Detection
--------------------------
The Facial Keypoint Detection project uses image processing and deep learning techniques to detect eyes, eyebrows, nose and mouth and overlay these facial features with colored points to evaluate the accuracy of the model.

Automatic Image Captioning
--------------------------
This project combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurring Neural Networks (RNN) machine learning algorithms to build a model that generates captions for an input image.

Landmark Detection & Tracking (SLAM)
-------------------------------------
Implements SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) of a robot in a 2 dimensional world.

These projects provide runnable code for anyone who is interested in understanding the fundamentals of computer vision.
